# Reference Architecture (Canonical)

This directory contains the canonical, cross-repo reference architecture and architectural decisions (ADRs).

It must remain relatively timeless.

Project progress, sprint updates, and implementation handovers are tracked in the implementation repository:
- voxeron-voice-agent/docs/HANDOVER.md

Versioned blueprint snapshots are stored in:
- docs/blueprints/
